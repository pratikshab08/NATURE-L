            <h2>MANIGAD FORT</h2>
            <P>
                Manikgad / (also called Gadchandur) (Marathi: माणिकगड / गडचांदूर) is an ancient fort in Chandrapur district, Maharashtra. It is a hill fort 507 metres above sea level built by the Naga kings in 9 CE.[1] The fort is in ruins and is frequented by wild animals that live in the vicinity, such as panthers and boars. Several monuments of historical importance are nearby.Manikgad was built by the last Mana Naga King - Gahilu. The Mana Nagas settled in this area around 9 CE. Initially, the fort was named Manikagad after the patron deity of the Mana Nagas - Manikadevi - but later on this was shortened to Manikgad.

                Local legend holds that the fort was built by a Gond king named Mankyal (hence the name Manikgad). However, the lintel of the entrance gate has a Naga image carved in relief and not the Gond emblem of a lion and an elephant.The fort was built of large black stones and was a formidable defense in its time. Rampart walls of the fort enclose a valley that has ruins of old buildings and store-houses. Outlines of apartments are visible against the rampart walls. The southern bastion, along with its supporting wall, collapsed.

                In the valley below lies a cannon that likely was mounted on that bastion. Unlike a cast-iron cannon, this cannon is made of several iron straps welded together. The gateway of the fort is intact.
                
                The Queen's palace is situated near a small dam with steps and a few rooms for bathing. Two wooden pagodas were constructed by the Forest Department. The fort area is filled with shrubs and trees.

If seen from long distance, it seems like fortress as its top has large rocky layers. Name satbahini means seven sisters which are Ambai, Nimbai, Muktai, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Mahakali and Durga. Their residential caves and temples are still there from ancient times. Every year from 1964, nearby people gather together for festivals like MakarSankranti and MahaShivratri. From top of hill, one can witness Sunset and Sunrise at specific time of day. Also there is presence of wild animals and birds during daytime. </p>

                                        Amalnala dam is located at the foothills of Manikgarh hillock in Gadchandur town of Chandrapur district in Maharashtra state. The medium-scale irrigation dam is a main source of water for surrounding villages and local industries. It is also a well-known tourist spot. From last couple of years, water of the dam is turning dark green, especially, in the month of August resulting in the increased viscosity and stinking of water. This increased our curiosity to test the water sample for any biological origins. Preliminary microscopic examination showed the presence of Microcystis, a neurotoxic cyanobacteria which is green in colour and probably imparts green colour to water. The excessive growth of single cell cyanobacteria or the algal bloom can be due to rise in nitrates and phosphate levels in water. Thus, it becomes necessary to study the source of nitrates and phosphates and its possible bioremediation with the help of microbes and effect of neurotoxin produced by cyanobacteria on animal and human health. This review discusses various factors such as turbidity, light, temperature, pesticides, fertilizers etc. for the greening of the Amalnala dam.
